CS-230 Operating Platforms

1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
   
   The Gaming Room is a company that makes games for Android phones currently, but wishes to branch out to web-based applications as well. Their first application is a game called "Draw It, or Lose It", meant to be accessed on multiple operating platforms from a web browser.
   
2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

   I feel I was able to understand the design constraints and domain model very well in this documentation.
   
3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

   Working through the domain model helped me understand the flow of the code better and how it should be laid out to optimize coding speed and security.
   
4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

   Looking back, I feel I could have been a bit more indepth on the Evaluation section of the design documentation.
   
5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

   I interpretted the user's needs by reading all requirements and constraints before developing an idea of how to address those needs. So that I wouldn't have to change one piece that had already been decided on when it conflicted with another part of the design.
   
6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

   In designing this software, I used the client-server achitectural pattern in order to properly handle the needs of the client. In the future I would use a similar or different pattern that best fit the client's needs and the design constraints.
